My solutions to the lessons

## Running

Get either [pixi](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) or [magic](https://docs.modular.com/magic/#install-magic)

To run the jupyter notebook in a given folder (example: ch1), simply run `pixi run --frozen ch1` (or `magic run --frozen ch1`).

### Troubleshooting

- The URL that auto-opens when you start the kernel may not work - try opening one of the alternate ones printed.
- You may need to click "Not Trusted" (and make it Trusted) at the top-right to resolve some Javascript errors.
- If using the Dark Reader browser extension, you may need to disable and re-enable it on the site to work correctly.
